# Workout-tracking-app-with-google-sheets
Workout Tracking Program that updates data onto google sheets.

This Program uses Natural Language Processing that is built with the Nutrionix API https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api

For example, input such as "I ran 2 miles and cycled for 20 minutes" will be processed into sheets with the corresponding exercise, estimated duration and estimated calories burnt
